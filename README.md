# Lighthouse-3m (AKA F*CK Lighthouse)

Lighthouse is ugly, old, difficult to use and nobody likes it. Buuuuuut... it has an API (YAY!).
So, out of boredom and willing to learn some front-end, I decided to learn some [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/) and try to improve our support experience at the same time.

Feel free to yell at me and change whatever you like. This is just an experiment and probably nobody will look at it after a month or so.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

### Code Generators
